This project presents an optimization model tailored for the Canadian Power Generation Sector, focusing on its emissions. Utilizing a stochastic lexicographic goal programming approach, the model aims to minimize year-on-year deviations across a spectrum of key objectives. Central to its design are four hierarchical objectives: the primary focus on reducing emissions, closely followed by meeting energy generation targets, ensuring capacity goals, and finally, incorporating cost considerations. The model robustly emphasizes environmental compliance, reinforcing the electricity system's reliability and feasibility by balancing supply and demand, while placing a secondary emphasis on economic factors. Additionally, the project features an interactive Streamlit dashboard, which displays the model's outcomes and insights.
